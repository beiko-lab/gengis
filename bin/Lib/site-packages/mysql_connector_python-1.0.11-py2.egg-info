        MySQL FOSS License Exception
        We want free and open source software applications under 
        certain licenses to be able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL 
        Connector/Python (specified GPL-licensed MySQL client libraries)
        despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are 
        compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.
        Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and
        conditions of the GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries, 
        which are identified and described in more detail in the 
        FOSS License Exception at
        <http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>

        GPLv2 Disclaimer
        For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice
        other than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, 
        Oracle elects to use only the General Public License version 2 
        (GPLv2) at this time for any software where a choice of GPL 
        license versions is made available with the language indicating 
        that GPLv2 or any later version may be used, or where a choice 
        of which version of the GPL is applied is otherwise unspecified.
