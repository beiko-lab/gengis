NCL README -- the NEXUS Class Library (NCL) README file

Most documentation for this C++ class library is in the form of HTML 
files in the html directory. Please begin by viewing the html/index.html
file in your web browser.

See the INSTALL file for important information about building and installing
the NCL and example programs, and incorporating the NCL into your own
applications.
